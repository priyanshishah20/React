## **Built movieZone page using React**
Different buttons are dynamically displayed based on movie categories such as Action, Thriller, Drama, etc. <br>
When a user clicks a category button (e.g., "Action"), the application fetches or filters movie data and displays corresponding movie posters in the UI.
